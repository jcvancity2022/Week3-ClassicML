        "This notebook serves as an introduction to working with audio data for classification problems; it is meant as a learning resource rather than a demonstration of the state-of-the-art. The techniques mentioned in this notebook apply not only to classification problems, but to regression problems and problems dealing with other types of input data as well. I provide an introduction to a few key machine learning models and the logic in choosing their hyperparameters. These objectives are framed by the task of recognizing emotion from snippets of speech audio.\n",

        "\n",
        "We'll go in chronological order. First is the support vector machine classifier (SVC) - a model from the 60s. SVMs are models quick to train for this task and best suited to small datasets due to its quadratic time complexity w.r.t. size of the training dataset (# of training samples). This is also the reason it breaks down with larger datasets since it becomes very expensive to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind SVMs on which the SVC model is based is to find a separating hyperplane - a subspace with dimension one less than that of the feature space - for points in our feature space; i.e. for a 3D space, a hyperplane is a regular plane, in 2D, a line. This idea extends to n dimensions. If points are separable by a hyperplane, they are said to be linearly separable. **Since there are infinite possible separating hyperplanes for any linearly separable feature space, an SVM computes which points are closest to each such hyperplane and uses them to construct a _support vector_. The SVM picks the hyperplane which maximizes the distance - _margin_ - to each support vector.** In this way, we maximize the separating ability of the chosen hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of SVMs is the kernel. We could map all new points from our input space, where they were not separable by a hyperplane, to a higher dimension in which we have found a hyperplane to separate the points in that space. However, that would be extremely computationally expensive for data that needs to be mapped to much higher dimensions. Instead, we **compute the hyperplane in the higher dimension on our training data and map the hyperplane back to the lower-dimension input space to use for classifying our data. This is the _kernel trick_, whereby the kernel (function) enables us to compute distances to new points in the input space without transforming each to the higher dimensional space - drastically reducing the computational complexity of the SVM.**\n",
